#### Hi!
I'm Sara, a medical statistician, data scientist and ex-consultant!

I am passionate about harnessing real world data and technology to drive evidence-based decisions and improve healthcare outcomes. In my research, I use routinely collected data (hospital episode records) to measure and explain variations in healthcare outcomes, with the aim of improving patient care. I also have worked with pervasive monitoring data (i.e., wearables) and large biobanks, like WSIC, UK Biobank, and CPRD. Having published 15+ studies, in a range of themes.

* 📚 Prior to my PhD, I spent 4 years at EY Parthenon as a senior strategy and data scienct consultant, in the healthcare and life-sciences space
* 🔬 I am also a Research Fellow within UCL's Department of Surgical Biotechnology, and previously with King's Health Partners
