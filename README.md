## Hi there 👋

I'm Sara, a Senior Data Science Consultant at EY, and Research Fellow within UCL's Department of Surgical Biotechnology and KCL's King's Health Partners. 

👩🏻‍💻 At EY I work with and advise healthcare and life-science entities (NHS Trusts, Biotechs, Pharmaceuticals, healthcare startups) on:

1. Go-to-market and market entry strategy
2. Commercial due diligence
3. Independent algorithm and technical reviews (Python, R)
4. Generating value from real world evidence using data held by entities, i.e., data strategies for commercial and research opportunities
5. Product and technical building of dashboards (Power BI, RShiny), back-end processing (SQL), capacity & demand models (Excel)

🔬 For my research posts, I work on the technical and statistical aspect of the ongoing projects relating to the public health aspect of the aesthetic and plastic surgery industry, as well as the application of tech, AI, and sustainability. I work with big datasets such as Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), surveys, primary collected data, Quality Improvement (QI) and audit, and wearables. I also oversee multiple medical students on various projects.

**🎓 Education**

I hold a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, and an MRes in Bioinformatics in Oncology, i.e., Computational Biology from Imperial College London with Distinction.
